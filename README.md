# Backlog-managment
The college backlog management system is a web-based application that simplifies the process of managing student backlogs in a college setting. It includes features such as timetable management, result announcement, and a dedicated student backlog page.
With the timetable management feature, administrators and faculty can create and manage class schedules, ensuring that students with backlogs have appropriate slots for attending remedial classes and exams.
The system automates the result announcement process for both regular and backlog exams, providing timely and accurate results to students. This helps in tracking their progress and identifying areas that need improvement.
Additionally, the system provides a dedicated student backlog page where students can view their backlog subjects, number of attempts, exam dates, and results. This helps students stay informed about their backlog status and progress.
Through automated notifications and reminders, the system keeps students updated about upcoming backlog exams, class schedules, and result announcements, ensuring they are well-prepared.
Overall, the college backlog management system simplifies the management of student backlogs, improves communication between students and faculty, and helps students clear their academic requirements effectively.
